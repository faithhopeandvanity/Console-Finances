# Console-Finances

Unit 4 Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with using JavaScript to return data relating to financial statistics on a data sheet.

The provided array provided a company's monthly net profits over a period of time.

The first piece of code I had to write was to count how many months there are in the period provided. The array had the variable finances, so I just needed to write finances.length under a new variable to tell me the number of strings, which would give me the number of months as each string represented one month.

To find the net total profit, I had to make a for loop to create rolling accumulation, and ensure the initial net total was calibrated to 0.
